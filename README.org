* Collection of LSP implementations

There are many Language Server Protocol implementations written in all kinds of languages.
They are good resources when studying the protocol itself. This repository puts them together
so one can only run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jirijakes/lsp-collection
#+END_SRC

and all of them are available for exploration.
